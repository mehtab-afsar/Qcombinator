export const samplePitchText = `We're TechFlow Solutions, and we're solving the massive productivity problem plaguing mid-market companies today.

The Problem: Mid-market companies waste 40% of their time on manual data entry and repetitive workflow tasks. This costs the average 500-person company $2.4M annually in lost productivity.

Our Solution: TechFlow is an AI-powered workflow automation platform that learns your business processes and automates them intelligently. Unlike generic tools like Zapier, we provide industry-specific AI models that understand context and make smart decisions.

Market: The workflow automation market is $12B and growing 23% annually. Mid-market companies (100-1000 employees) represent a $3.2B opportunity that's currently underserved.

Traction: In 18 months, we've grown to:
- 1,200 beta users across 50 companies
- $25K monthly recurring revenue
- 20% month-over-month growth
- 40% productivity improvement for our clients

Team: Our team combines deep AI expertise (ex-OpenAI, Google) with enterprise software experience (ex-Salesforce, Microsoft). Our CTO published 15 papers on workflow optimization.

Fundraising: We're raising $2M Series A to expand our sales team and accelerate product development. We have strong interest from enterprise clients and a clear path to $10M ARR within 24 months.`
